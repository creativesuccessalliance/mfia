<h3 style="margin-top: 0">Can I be as successful as the people in your testimonials?</h3>
<p>That’s a very good question, and it’s one that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants us to be able to tell you with as much certainty as we can. As of December 1, 2009 – the date the new FTC regulations went into effect – we can’t really give you the odds that you will be successful, but we are working on gathering that information. The new FTC rules require any company which uses testimonials from its customers to entice others – you – to buy its products and services, must also tell you how probable it is that you will be as successful as the person who is in the testimonial. All the people who have proven to be successful using our products and services are extraordinary people, but we can’t tell you that every extraordinary person will be successful. What we do know right now is that the students who are sharing their stories with us have purchased a variety of our products and services ranging in price from less than a thousand dollars to more than ten thousand dollars to achieve these results. Also, none of the students have been compensated for allowing us to retell their stories.</p>
