                    <h2>Dear Real Estate Investor,</h2>
                    <p>As you may know, multi-family investing is the buying, selling and/or holding of multi-family properties for monthly cash flow, equity appreciation and short term or long term profit. Properties can be “flipped” (bought and sold quickly) for immediate profit or held for long term gain and wealth creation.</p>
                    <p>Now is a good time to start investing in multi-family properties. When you signup today for our <a href="#opt-in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#opt-in"><strong>FREE 5-Day Online Training Course</strong></a>, we'll send you our <strong>Quick Start Printout</strong>, a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly what you need to do in order to get started in multi-family investing.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said that more wealth will be created in the next two years than the following eleven years combined.</p>
                    <h2>How do I know this?</h2>
                    <p>My name is David Lindahl and along with co-authoring a book with Donald Trump I also wrote the book on real estate market cycles, it's called
                        <em>Emerging Real Estate Markets</em>&nbsp;and it sat in the number one best seller list for quite a while.</p>
                    <p>Over the last 18 years, I have controlled over 8,200 units and like many real estate investors, I started out owning nothing and bought my first three family property that got me started in the exciting and secure arena of multi-family real estate investing.</p>
                    <p>Before you consider investing with multi-family homes, here are seven things you must know...</p>
