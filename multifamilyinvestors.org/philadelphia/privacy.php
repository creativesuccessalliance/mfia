<h3>A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>
<h3>(ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 –OPPA)</h3>
<p>It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act. Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. This is not usually personally identifiable. If you purchase a product or service via this website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal information to third parties. There is no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive any information about our database. In the event that the website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded to the website in order to insure that the website is releasing information to the correct party. All reasonable effor will be made to ascertain the identity of the requesting party. Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying. While we take measures to ensure that outside parties do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access to your information. (You should know that merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.) This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice. You are required to read it prior to using the website. By interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy. By using the website or purchasing a product through this website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a city and county specified herein.</p>
<h3>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</h3>
<p>Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the website. If you do not accept these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</h3>
<p>This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such as: When you order real estate investing material from this site, we need to know your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order, and contact you if necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, we collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available when you visit this website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your visit, and which pages you visited. We use this information to determine on average which pages are popular, and what content we may want to improve upon in the future.</p>
<p>Will we disclose to outside parties the information we collect? We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others, ever. We would release information only if we believed, in good faith, that such release was reasonably necessary to comply with law, or protect the rights, property or safety of rementor.com, our customers, or others. It’s not ever been necessary, to date.</p>

This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
<h3>ONLINE ORDERING</h3>
<p>Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but often does not provide complete credit card numbers.

You should consider all this information available to the website. This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>

<p>Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions: one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to the general ‘SUBMISSION’ agreement of this policy.
