            <h3>Dear Philadelphia Area Real Estate Investor,</h3>
            <p>As you may know, multi-family investing is the buying, selling and/or holding of multi-family properties for monthly capital flow, equity appreciation and short term or long term profit. Properties can be “flipped” (bought and sold quickly) for immediate profit or held for long term gain and wealth creation.</p>
			<p>Multi-family investing can increase capital flow and obtain future appreciation and now is a good time to start investing in multi-family properties.</p>
            <h3>How do I know this?</h3>
            <p>My name is David Lindahl and along with co-authoring a book with Donald Trump I also wrote the book on real estate market cycles, it's called "Emerging Real Estate Markets" and it sat in the number one best seller list for quite a while.</p>
            <p>I've been a real estate investor for the last 18 years and currently control own over 7,000 units across this great country of ours. Like many real estate investors, I started out owning nothing and bought my first three family property that got me started in the exciting and secure arena of multi-family real estate investing.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3 class="text-center">Seven Things You Should Know Right Now<br>About Multi Family Investing</h3>
            <p><strong>1) Multi Family properties can protect your wealth.</strong>&nbsp;You’ve worked hard, you’ve established yourself. Over time, real estate values always go up. One of the safest investments you can make is putting your money in real estate. The benefit of Multi Family real estate is it gives you capital flow while it appreciates!</p>
            <p><strong>2) You can put your property on autopilot.</strong>&nbsp;Buy a property, hire a good qualified management company to run it and while you continue to enjoy life and travel to your favorite spots around the globe you’re management company will oversee the day to day operations of your investment...delegation is the key to happiness!</p>
            <p><strong>3) Invest where you can get the biggest returns in the shortest amount of time.</strong>&nbsp;Institutional investors do this and you can to with the strategy of investing in emerging markets. These markets explode with appreciation and you’ll be the envy of your friends when you share with them your portfolio returns.</p>
            <p><strong>4) Buying “under valued” properties is the best way to boost your upside and limit your downside potential.</strong>&nbsp;Value add properties are properties that need a little “help”. Help that a good qualified management company knows how to administer while you reap the rewards in your return column.</p>
            <p><strong>5) The faster you go big, the faster you get bigger returns.</strong>&nbsp;Small properties are good but small properties are for beginning investors. You’ve earned the status you enjoy today, larger properties will bring you larger returns with less risk, that’s the irony but you already know this.</p>
            <p><strong>6) That being said, if multi family investing is new to you, start where you are comfortable.</strong>&nbsp;Get educated, take action, take calculated risks, get the confidence of having your first deal under you belt and then watch your portfolio grow.</p>
            <p><strong>7) Using a proven system gets you to your goals faster.</strong>&nbsp;You have used systems in your day to day life, it makes sense to use them in your real estate investing. Proven systems bring you proven results.</p>

        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp;Thank You Dave and your team! Since attending your training and implementing your strategies, you have helped me take my real estate investing business to the next level. I have had so much success in such a short period of time and it is all due to your guidance! You have made me realize that the bigger numbers are just as easy. I am now working on some larger deals right now, because I know that they are just as easy as the small ones. I would have never done any of this if it wasn’t for you and your team's help!&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

After going through your training, I have already made several changes in my business and I am in the process of implementing several new marketing plans, not one or two, but several.

        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp;I went to Dave Lindahl’s training in December last year. I actually met 2 of my partners there at the event. We started looking for apartment buildings in some of the emerging markets that Dave and his team mention around the US. The training truly shows you how to finance any deal. I didn’t have any money just like most people. But Dave and his team taught me how to go out and get it done. I am living proof. Thanks Dave and your team for all of the help and guidance.&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
