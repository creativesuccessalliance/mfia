            <h3>Dear Philadelphia Area Real Estate Investor,</h3>
            <p>As you may know, multi-family investment is the buying, selling and/or holding of multi family homes for monthly capital flow, equity appreciation and short term or long term profit. Properties can be “flipped” (bought and sold quickly) for immediate profit or held for long term gain and wealth creation.</p>
            <p>Multi-family investing can increase capital flow and obtain future appreciation and now is a good time to start investing in multi-family properties.
</p>
            <h3>How do I know this?</h3>
            <p>My name is David Lindahl and along with co-authoring a book with Donald Trump I also wrote the book on real estate market cycles, it's called "Emerging Real Estate Markets" and it sat in the number one best seller list for quite a while.</p>
            <p>I've been a real estate investor for the last 18 years and currently control own over 7,000 units across this great country of ours. Like many real estate investors, I started out owning nothing and bought my first three family property that got me started in the exciting and secure arena of apartment investing.

            <h3 class="text-center">Seven Things You Should Know Right Now<br>About Multi Family Investing</h3>
            <p><strong>1) Multi Family homes can protect your wealth.</strong>&nbsp;You’ve worked hard, you’ve established yourself. Over time, multi family investment values always go up. One of the safest investments you can make is putting your money in multi family homes. The benefit of multi family investment is it gives you capital flow while it appreciates!</p>
            <p><strong>2) You can put your multi family homes on autopilot.</strong>&nbsp;Buy a  multi family investment, hire a good qualified management company to run it and while you continue to enjoy life and travel to your favorite spots around the globe you’re management company will oversee the day to day operations of your multi family investment...delegation is the key to happiness!</p>
            <p><strong>3) Invest where you can get the biggest returns in the shortest amount of time.</strong>&nbsp;Institutional investors do this and you can to with the strategy of apartment investing in emerging markets. These markets explode with appreciation and you’ll be the envy of your friends when you share with them your portfolio returns and knowlege of how to buy apartments.</p>
            <p><strong>4) Buying “under valued” multi family homes is the best way to boost your upside and limit your downside potential.</strong>&nbsp;Value add properties are multi family homes that need a little “help”. Help that a good qualified management company knows how to administer while you reap the rewards in your return column.</p>
            <p><strong>5) The faster you go big, the faster you get bigger returns.</strong>&nbsp;Small properties are good but small properties are for beginning investors. You’ve earned the status you enjoy today, larger multi family homes
 will bring you larger returns with less risk, that’s the irony but you already know this.</p>
            <p><strong>6) That being said, if apartment investing is new to you, start where you are comfortable.</strong>&nbsp;Get educated, take action, take calculated risks, get the confidence of having your first deal under you belt and knowlege of how to buy properties and then watch your portfolio grow.</p>
            <p><strong>7) Using a proven system gets you to your goals faster.</strong>&nbsp;You have used systems in your day to day life, it makes sense to use them in your apartment investing. Proven systems bring you proven results.</p>

 I didn’t have any money just like most people. But Dave and his team taught me how to go out and get it done. I am living proof. Thanks Dave and your team for all of the help and guidance.&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>

                <p>Now is a great time to purchase multi family homes! Let’s face it; we are now living in a buyers market. With more and more multi family homes on the market, sellers are facing some stiff competition, and are being forced to lower their prices in order to contend with other hungry sellers. This leaves ambitious buyers with a great opportunity, however, while timing could not be more perfect to learn how to buy properties, it is vital to know what kind of multi family investment is going to best maximize your profits. After all, the goal of apartment investing is making as much money as possible, while spending little.</p>

<p>When most people think about apartment investing, the first thing that comes to their mind is duplexes and single-family homes. This is because many people are under the false impression that certain money saving strategies like fix and flip, and no money down is only available when buying single-family units. In fact, these same options are available when purchasing multi-family homes like apartment buildings. In reality, purchasing an apartment building is often the smarter, and most cost effective choice. An apartment building can be easier to occupy, less time consuming, and can also be the most efficient way to maximize your profit.</p>
<p>With the demand for houses increasing in today’s buyers market, developers are continuing to build more homes. As we all know “demand” gives these developers the power to price these new properties as they see fit, and that price is more than likely going to be high, however, many people cannot afford to pay the $1,200.00 mortgage that comes along with the increased price of the home and look to a more affordable way to live. In this case, apartments, with their lower monthly rent, become more appealing to buyers.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">6 Ways to Generate Multi-Family Apartment Investing Deals</h3>
<p>Lead generation is a foundational activity of your multi family investment business. Without it, you’ll fail before you even begin. Many people don’t think they have the time or the energy to find deals. I don’t care how busy people tell me they are. My response is always the same – if you want it bad enough, you’ll make time for the important things. When you discover how to buy apartments and how easy it is to get started, you’ll be kicking yourself for not starting earlier. Here are six ways to generate apartment investing deals.</p>

<p><strong>1) Direct Mail</strong></p>

<p>Direct mail is one of my favorites. In fact, it’s how I got started. After I would get home late at night, I’d always make sure I’d stuff envelopes and get those letters out. Why? Those letters represented my future success. There are many investors shunning the idea of snail mail, but the truth is, it’s still works and it’s still a great way to generate leads.</p>

<p><strong>2) Reading the Classifieds</strong></p>

<p>With the number of short sales, pre-foreclosures, and foreclosures on the market, you’ll be sure to find something in the classifieds section of your local newspaper. Be diligent and read each ad. The more ads you read, the more you’ll become familiar with them and know how to spot a potential deal. That’s what I did and after awhile, I started calling these people. The more ads I called, the easier it got to make those calls and eventually, I ended up getting a couple of deals that way.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Putting Together Winning Multi Family Investment Deals <br>Without Risking Your Own Money</h3>
<img src="img/real-estate-handshake.jpg" class="pull-left img-thumbnail" style="margin-right: 10px">
<p>The secret to making big money in apartment investment is syndication, and I will explain why that is in a minute. First let’s focus on something important: every investment entails some risk, and successful investors are great at minimizing the risk. Not just for themselves but also for everyone else involved with them.</p>

<p>This means that as a real estate investor you must be quick at putting together deals using syndicates. Essentially a syndicate is a group of investors representing an interest in breaking in the multi family investment market. They can put up a certain amount of cash and get fronted by a professional.</p>

<p>If you are clever about it and you have began to establish your credentials, build up a reputation and can talk the talk in a way that convinces people to trust you with their money, then you are off to a flying start. It means that you will bring credentials, the ability to close profitable deals and expert negotiating skills to the table.</p>
